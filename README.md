# MAD-Level06_Example
Example task of the sixth level assignment in "Mobile Application Development" at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (Computer Science, 5th semester).

## Task
We will be building a quiz app where the user can create a question he wants someone to answer. For simplicity of this example we will be restricting the app to one question, and they won't be stored in Room. If you want to implement this yourself you are free to do so.
